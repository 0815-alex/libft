# libft-gnl-printf
In this repository, I have strategically merged the three foundational 42 projects:
- libft
- get_next_line (gnl)
- ft_printf

This integration aims to leverage the strengths of these projects, which are designed to be used together for various C programming tasks. I use this repo in the following projects:
- [fdf](https://github.com/ahokcool/fdf)
- [push_swap](https://github.com/ahokcool/push_swap)
- [minitalk](https://github.com/ahokcool/minitalk)
- [minishell](https://github.com/ahokcool/frankenshell)
- [cub3D](https://github.com/ahokcool/cub3D)
